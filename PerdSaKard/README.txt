============== Practicum for Computer Engineering (01204233) Year 2018 ===============

==== INTRODUCTION ====
	Nowadays, air pollutions majorly impacts our daily life. Temperature, humidity, dust etc. are also considered pollutions. These problems inspired us to solve this problem. We will scope the problems down into the humidity problem. As we had researched about this problem, we found out that humidity mainly impact our health and our environment. So, our propose for our invention is to measure the air humidity in the room. If the humidity is beyond the safe line, the warning window will pop up and the alarm will go off. We can control the car loaded with the humidity measure equipment to wherever we want to measure. Now, we can know which area are excess in humidity so that we can eventually put the desiccant to reduce the level of humidity.
